# Analyzing Tux-Racer (Commercial Edition)
i just wanted to analyze tux racer commercial edition for fun

anyways

heres some things i found:
some images were made with Software Adobe ImageReady

the directory of the tux racer source code is E:\users\jfpatry\tuxracer\tuxracer-cvs\

some leaked minimal source code of tux racer 1.1: 

![Screenshot](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/spielerkapitan/Analyzing-Tux-Racer-1.1/refs/heads/main/The%20Secret%20Uncovered.png)

after "Expression:" thats the minimal leaked source code

this also reveals why it crashes sometimes with the music enabled when you have the original sdl.dll that comes included with the game itself

i also wonder, why cant we just make somehow the c++ redistributable log the whole source code of tux racer 1.1?

# Less Technical things:

found texture matching in this texture:

The Original Texture:

found this pallete of terrains in versions earlier than 1.1

as you can see, theres an test terrain called "vwall"


also theres a list of objects of tux racer 0.61 ( free version )
